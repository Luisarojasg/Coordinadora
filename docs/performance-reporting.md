# Performance Test Reporting Documentation

## Accessing Reports

### Live Report
The live performance test report is available at:
```

```

This report provides real-time insights into test execution and results.

### Detailed Reports
Detailed reports are generated in the `performance-reports` directory:
- Load Test Report: `performance-report.md`
- Stress Test Report: `performance-report-stress.md`
- Response Time Charts: 
  - `response-time-chart.png` (Load Test)
  - `response-time-chart-stress.png` (Stress Test)

## Running Tests

To generate new reports:

1. Load Test:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/performance/load-test.spec.ts
```

2. Stress Test:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/performance/stress-test.spec.ts
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Testing**
   - Run load tests weekly
   - Run stress tests monthly
   - Compare results with previous runs

2. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor error rates
   - Track response times
   - Watch for performance degradation

3. **Optimization**
   - Implement recommended improvements
   - Test after each optimization
   - Document performance improvements

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Report Not Accessible**
   - Ensure the test server is running
   - Check if port 9323 is available
   - Verify test execution completed

2. **Missing Reports**
   - Check `performance-reports` directory
   - Verify test execution completed successfully
   - Check file permissions

3. **Incorrect Results**
   - Verify test configuration
   - Check API endpoint availability
   - Validate test parameters
